# Machine Learning Models
Grouping and programming machine learning algorithms.
There are different ways an algorithm can model a problem based on its interaction with the experience or environment or whatever we want to call the input data.

It is popular in machine learning and artificial intelligence textbooks to first consider the learning styles that an algorithm can adopt.
Letâ€™s take a look at three different learning styles in machine learning algorithms:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning

Algorithms Grouped By Similarity:

1. Regression Algorithms
2. Regularization Algorithms
