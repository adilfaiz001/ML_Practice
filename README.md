# Machine Learning Models
Grouping and programming machine learning algorithms.
There are different ways an algorithm can model a problem based on its interaction with the experience or environment or whatever we want to call the input data.

It is popular in machine learning and artificial intelligence textbooks to first consider the learning styles that an algorithm can adopt.
Letâ€™s take a look at two different learning styles in machine learning algorithms:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning

## Supervised Learning
Input data is called training data and has a known label or result such as spam/not-spam or a stock price at a time.

A model is prepared through a training process in which it is required to make predictions and is corrected when those predictions are wrong. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.

## Unsupervised Learning
Input data is not labeled and does not have a known result.

A model is prepared by deducing structures present in the input data. This may be to extract general rules. It may be through a mathematical process to systematically reduce redundancy, or it may be to organize data by similarity.

Sub-classifications of these algorithms and their sklearn implementation are given in sub folders at their level hierarchy.
